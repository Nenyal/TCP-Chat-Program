 # TCP Chat Program
 
Hi. In this project, I made a chat program that works with the TCP protocol.

# Descriptions
Server establishes a connection with the Client and creates a ClientHandler object for each client object.
ClientHandler allows messages to be received as input and shared with other clients.
Client establishes a connection with Server and sends messages to Server.
